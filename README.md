# Neutral.af - Web

This is the source of the Vue.js frontend for the neutral.af site.

## Getting Started

First, run `yarn` to pull the dependencies.

Then, create a `.env` file with `cp .env.template .env`. Add a stripe public key to the `.env` file. You should already have the backend server running on your machine, or change the backend URL in the `.env` file.

Finally, run `yarn dev` to start the dev server.
