We'll try and make it short and simple; we want this privacy policy to be human-readable. If you have any questions or concerns, please write to us.

At Neutral.af, we donâ€™t collect any information about you (aside from what is strictly necessary to facilitate your purchase). Any information you submit to us is passed on to our partners. We never retain it for any duration of time.

Here you'll find the privacy policy of each of our partners:

- [Stripe (payment processing)](https://stripe.com/privacy)
- [Cloverly (offset provider)](https://cloverly.com/privacy-policy)
- [SimpleAnalytics (user monitoring)](https://simpleanalytics.com/privacy)
- [Honeycomb (technical monitoring)](https://www.honeycomb.io/privacy/)

When we make an estimate to purchase a carbon offset (and when that offset is purchased), the offset is facilitated by Cloverly. The invoice for the Cloverly purchase is handled by us. That means Cloverly doesn't have any information about you at all, aside from how many kilos of carbon you've offset. They won't even know your name.

Our payments are handled by Stripe. Stripe are the only party that stores your raw payment details. Stripe has an extensive privacy policy that covers how they handle your personal data when processing a payment. They also may observe user behaviour elsewhere on the site, for the purpose of reducing fraud.

When you choose to save a favourite card (so that you don't have to put in the card details again the next time) we send the card information directly to Stripe. They store this information and give us a "customer ID" and "payment method ID". We place these only in your browser cookies. If you clear your cookies those payment details will be disassociated from your browser. You can always re-enter and save them again next time.

We use SimpleAnalytics as a privacy-friendly tool for getting information on how people find and use our site. SimpleAnalytics doesn't track any personal information, and we've made our analysis dashboard public.

Honeycomb is used in both our backend and frontend code to monitor errors and evaluate performance. We use the estimate ID as a way of tracking the lifetime of an estimate across our frontend and backend services. No personal information is sent to Honeycomb.

If you (or a programmer friend) would like to verify the above, 100% of our code is available to review [on Github](https://www.github.com/neutral-af).
