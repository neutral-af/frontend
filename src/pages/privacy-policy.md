We want this privacy policy to be human-readable, so we’ll try and make it short and simple. Please write to us if you have any questions or concerns.

At Neutral.af, we don’t collect any information about you aside from what is strictly necessary to facilitate your purchase. Any information you submit to us is passed on to our partners and never retained by us for any duration of time.

Here you'll find the privacy policy of each of our partners:

- [Stripe (payment processing)](https://stripe.com/privacy)
- [Cloverly (offset provider)(https://cloverly.com/privacy-policy)
- [Honeycomb (technical monitoring)(https://www.honeycomb.io/privacy/)

When making an estimate to purchase a carbon offset, as well as when that offset is purchased, the transaction is facilitated by Cloverly. The invoice for the Cloverly purchase is handled by us, which means Cloverly doesn’t have any information about you at all, aside from how many kilos of carbon you’ve offset - they won’t even know your name.

Our payments are handled by Stripe, who are the only ones that store your raw payment details. Stripe has an extensive privacy policy that covers how they handle your personal data when processing a payment. They also may observe user behaviour elsewhere on the site for the purpose of reducing fraud.

When you choose to save a favourite card, so that you don’t have to put in the card details again the next time, we send the card information directly to Stripe. They store this information and give us a “customer ID” and “payment method ID”, which we place only in your browser cookies. If you clear your cookies, those payment details will be disassociated from your browser - but you can always re-enter and save them again next time.

Honeycomb is used in both our backend and frontend code to monitor errors and evaluate performance. We use the estimate ID as a way of tracking the lifetime of an estimate across our frontend and backend services, but no personal information is sent to Honeycomb.

If you (or a programmer friend of yours) would like to verify, all our code is available to review [on Github](github.com/neutral-af).
